### Experimentation_LoRaWAN

A university project aimed at utilizing a LoRaWAN architecture to test the network's performance.

## **Work Conducted by a Team of Three:**
- **Aimen NABI** (Node-RED Engineer)  
- **Dylan BRILLAUD** (Data Analyst Engineer)  
- **Aissa Hadj Bader** (Sense HAT Engineer)  

## **Architecture**
The LoRaWAN network used consists of **five gateways** connected to an MQTT broker.

## **Methodology**
We transmitted data to the gateways using a LoRa antenna, and then retrieved this data by subscribing to the corresponding topic via Node-RED.
